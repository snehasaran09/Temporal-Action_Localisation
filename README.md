# Temporal-Labelling-of-Actions-in-Videos is 2 credit mini Project my team did under the guidance of Dr.Mamatha HR in my third semester in B.tech.
This projects aims to determine the action in videos , smoothen noise in videos and obtain the exact timeframe in which the movement occurs in videos. 
The aim behind this projects was to help police officials and all those viewing long hours of cctv videos just to detect action .
